                <h2>Margin: the edge of a surface.</h2>
                <h2>Marginal: written in the margin, of or at the edge, not central, and not significant.</h2>
                <p>Beverly Gordon, in Textiles, The Whole Story, contends that “living as we do in a post- industrial world, 
                    fabric has become ubiquitous and inexpensive. Most of us are very distant from its production, and the magic of cloth-
                    making has thus for the most part become invisible”. Although textiles are central to life and, as globally distributed 
                    commodities, are major items of consumption (and waste) in “developed” countries, making textiles in such countries is 
                    not only almost invisible but, as a set of creative practices that include embroi- dery, marginalised. The reasons for 
                    this were eloquently argued in 1984 by Rozsika Parker in her ground-breaking study of the developmentof embroidery in Europe,
                     The Subversive Stitch. Parker asserted that embroidery, rather than being a universal and timeless practice, is a socially 
                     and culturally embedded art form with meanings that change over time. Drawing on historical sources, she argued that the 
                     gradual conflation over five centuries of embroidery with “the feminine” led to embroidery in the twentieth century becoming 
                     a marginalised domestic craft largely practised by women. Little has changed in the twenty-first century. However, despite being 
                     doubly marginalised by this association with the feminine and the domestic sphere, the practice of embroidery retains its magic
                      and can be a generative space for considering the concept of subjectivity, considered here not in relation to objectivity, but 
                      rather as a singular consciousness para- doxically produced within community.</p>

                <h2>Story</h2>
                <p class="indented">
                    For better or for worse, I’ve begun to make my texts as territories where I can tell stories. It’s the genre of these stories which 
                    was perhaps a little strange, because I wanted to write very delicate stories, the ones which are hardly ever told, except when one 
                    talks in a space of intimacy. When, in the evening, I feel like recounting what has happened that day, I do not recount a novel, I 
                    recount an intimate gesture someone made, or a little drama which might hold great meaning.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Here, He ́le`ne Cixous speaks of text as a territory where stories can be told. The etymological connection between text and textiles
                     suggests that a textile too can be a territory, a sphere of action and thought where body and mind work as one to create a narrative 
                     in and of the cloth. Such a narrative might be tightly bound by the edges of the cloth, by the selvedge, and the limit of the warps—a 
                     tale told through densely woven material and structure. But what if the story could extend beyond these limits to speak of the maker, 
                     her subjectivity and relationship to her community and a world in which cloth falls apart, becomes fragile, threadbare, and worn out 
                     by the body’s use, where mending cloth becomes a form of restitution, an unattainable longing for wholeness in a world experienced as 
                     fragmentary and unpredictable?

                <p>
                    Such are these stories about stitching.

                <p>Self þ Edge: While “self ” in this context means self-same, its other meaning of “a sense of self ” suggests a subject prevented from unravelling 
                    by a tightly woven edge, not only conceiving subjectivity as in construction, but, in the absence of a defining edge, unstable. This combination 
                    of concepts recalls the primacy of textile words as metaphors for human experience. The Germanic etymology of the word “cloth”, for example, 
                    conceives cloth as “that which clings to the body”, thus evoking the intimate sensation of touch.

                <h2>Stitch as Body</h2>
                <p>
                    In her discussion of corporeal phenomenology in Volatile Bodies, Elizabeth Grosz refers to Maurice Merleau-Ponty’s concept of “body schema” 
                    as (among other things) “the field in which the subject’s cohesion and identity as a subject and its intimate incarnation in and as aparticular 
                    body takes place”. Merleau-Ponty himself uses a figure from textiles, a woven cloth, to delineate the interrelatedness of body and mind in the 
                    development of subjectivity; “my body is the fabric into which all objects are woven, and it is, at least in relation to the perceived world,
                    the general instrument of my comprehension”. Grosz, wary of Merleau-Ponty’s uncritical assumption of a generalised subjectivity that coheres 
                    through the body schema and does not take into account the question of gendered bodies and sexual difference, proposes a more dynamic and 
                    uncontainable figure, the Mo ̈ bius strip, which, while suggesting the double-sided flexibility of cloth, disrupts any sense of patterned 
                    fixity or stability in order to show:
                </p>
                <p class="indented">
                    the inflection of mind into body and body into mind, the ways in which, through a kind of twisting or inversion, one side becomes another. 
                    This model also provides a way of problematizing and rethinking the relations between the inside and the outside of the subject, its psychical 
                    interior and its corporeal exterior, by showing not their fundamental identity or reducibility but the torsion of the one into the other, the 
                    passage, vector, or uncontrollable drift of the inside into the outside and the outside into the inside.
                </p>
                <p>Drawing on Grosz’s conception of subjectivity as bodily, dynamic, and uncontainable, this essay proposes the practice of stitching kantha 
                    (embroidered quilts from Bengal) as generating such a space, where the embroiderer, as she stitches, creates her world as her world creates her.

                <p>
                    Masuma Akther was born in Chittagong, Bangladesh, and was taught to stitch kantha as a child by her mother. As her mother only used kantha 
                    phor when sewing a cloth, Masuma was taught more complex embroi- dery stitches by friends and neighbours. At that time, in the latter years
                     of the twentieth century, kantha skills were still passed on to girls of her generation, but coming from an urban, middle class family with
                      access to formal education, Masuma was also expected to do well at school and complete ter tiar y education. Her father’s fear that practising 
                      embroidery might distract her from her studies27 proved unfounded, as Masuma not only completed her schooling, but gained teaching qualifications
                       and a Master’s degree in botany. She worked as an assistant teacher of biology at Chittagong Cantonment Public College after her marriage to 
                       Ziaul Hoque Chowdhury, before they came to Australia as skilled migrants in 2009.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Arriving in Adelaide and hoping to access the better employment and educational oppor tu- nities offered by a developed country, especially 
                    for their son Raad, Masuma discovered a more stable society than her homeland, but one that was also unimaginably different. Despite being a 
                    highly educated professional, her dream of teaching in Australia depends upon her achiev- ing an appropriate IELTS (International English 
                    Language Testing System) level of proficiency in the English language. While she improves her English, she has drawn upon her textile skills 
                    to earn a living, through crocheting and embroider- ing neck pieces and garments for Australian fashion designer Sally Phillips, and teaching 
                    nakshi kantha workshops for Craftsouth.

                </p>
                <p>
                    In 2012, Masuma and I began a collaborative project to stitch a group of cloths in the nakshi kantha tradition about basha (home) for the 
                    Craftsouth exhibition, “The Third Space: Intercultural Crafting”, an extension of the Traditional Craft Skills program. Exchanging remnants 
                    of new and used fabric along with stories about home and our cultural traditions, we stitched a series of cloths to tell of our attachment 
                    to place. Masuma’s small embroi- dery shapla (Figure 1), stitched on the green cloth I gave her, depicts the white waterlily that is the 
                    national flower of Bangladesh, a country permeated by water, situated as it is in the delta of the Ganges and Brahmaputra rivers. The
                    radial form of the water lily, although a different
                    genus, recalls the lotus, a flower with deep
                    symbolic significance in the Indic tradition and
                    one that is often embroidered as the
                    abstracted, radiating centre of a kantha cloth.
                    According to Stella Kramrisch, a key scholar
                    and collector of kantha in Bengal in the mid-twentieth century, this image of the lotus as a 
                    central point, radiating outwards, but contained within the borders of the cloth, suggests:
                </p>
                <p class="indented">
                    the working of mind itself, its beginning from a point, the centre, its building up from there the 
                    radii and petals of the lotus, its reaching out towards its own fulfilment which is the circumference
                     of the circle, its hovering there . . . and altogether coming to a rest in the square or rectangular
                     precinct of the “Kantha as a whole”.

        <div class="element territory">
            <div class="text">
               <h2>Territory</h2> 
               <p>
                If kantha can be understood as a kind of territory that maps women’s experience, it’s
                also a way of defining space, even as it extends beyond the margins of the cloth to 
                consolidate relationships; laid on the ground, kantha delineates the convivial space 
                of sharing a meal; used in ritual, kantha creates the space that mitigates the danger 
                of transition when an individual moves from one state to another. During the marriage 
                ceremony, where each partner takes on a new identity, the bride- groom is wrapped in a 
                kantha shawl from the bride’s family to locate him “bodily and spatially
                in [the bride’s] natal terrain [and protect] his
                vulnerable body at a momentous personal transition”.
               </p>
               <p>
                Within this territory, marked by the borders of the cloth and conventions of tradition,
                 there is room for the imaginative expression of the kantha embroiderer in her choice 
                 and use of imagery. But what this patterning might signify for her and her community 
                 cannot always be pinned down as, like the surface of a cloth itself, meaning is dynamic 
                 and fluid, changing in relation to different subjectivities places, and times. As a cloth
                 kantha is dynamic  and does not lie flat. Basting and stitching layers of cloth together
                  with thread causes tiny ripples and soft ridges to emerge so the stitched cloth gently 
                  undulates like the ground, becoming a terrain that traces the movement of the needle. 
                  Tim Ingold’s discussion of weaving a basket as a play of forces between maker and material
                   could well apply to stitching a kantha:
               </p>
               <p class="indented">
                the form of the [stitched cloth] is the
                result of the play of forces, both internal
                and external to the material that makes it
                up. One could say that the form unfolds
                within a kind of force field, in which the
                maker is caught up in a reciprocal...dialogue with the material.
               </p>
               <p>
                Elizabeth Grosz, in Chaos, Territory, Art, proposes that art itself 
                is a kind of force field, a territory that fabricates a space where 
                sensation may emerge, "enabl[ing] matter to become expressive, to 
                not just satisfy but also to intensify—to resonate and become more than itself ”.
                It is in this sense as well that the bodily actions and materials that create kantha,
                 the rhythmic pricking and pulling of needle and thread in and out of a woven 
                 surface, create a territory, a field of sensation and affect.

                <p class="indented">
                    The poetics of cloth are composed of folds, fragments and surfaces of infinite complexity. 
                    The fragment bears witness to a broken whole: yet it is also a site of uncertainty from
                     which to start over; it is where the mind extends beyond fragile boundaries, beyond 
                     frayed and indeterminate edges, expanding in the fluidity of the smooth. The surface 
                     is a liminal space, both inside and out, a space of encounter.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In 2008, just before Masuma arrived in Australia, my friend, Diana Wood Conroy, gave me a cloth, 
                    an old linen pillow case, worn, torn, and mended, but now too fragile to use. Made by women in the 
                    family of her great- grandmother, Jessie Inglis Mackie, ne ́e Arbuckle (1853 – 1945) in Glasgow, 
                    a city at the centre of the British textile industry, this cloth speaks from a different tradition 
                    than kantha. It was sewn in the latter years of the nineteenth century in an industrialised city at 
                    the heart of the British Empire by young French seams- tresses brought to Scotland to sew fine bed linen 
                    for the Mackies, a wealthy Presbyterian family with interests in both cloth manufactur- ing and ship building.
                     The pillow case was cut and French-seamed from fine Scottish linen, with a delicate line of drawn thread work
                      stitched on the inner border that marked the edge of the pillow. It was then passed on to the daughters 
                      of the house to embroider, white on white, with sprigs of clover in a central motif and along the scalloped
                       outer borders. White- work floral embroidery was practised by upper class women in nineteenth-century Scotland as
                       a sign of class, taste, and leisure, with mothers passing on embroidery skills to their daughters,
                       to bind their relationship while preparing the daughter for married life.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The pillow case, one of a pair designed for the marital bed and set aside for the trousseau of Jessie’s daughter,
                     Ida Mackie Carment (1887 – 1961), was brought to Australia in 1914 after her marriage to naval architect David 
                     Shallard Carment, along with her trousseau of embroi- dered household linen and a fine porcelain dinner service.
                      Ida gave many pieces of bed and table linen to her daughter, Marion Carment Wood, who, in turn, passed them on 
                      to her daughter, Diana. The pillowcase, worn and softened under the pressure of years of sleeping heads, had 
                      been crudely mended many times. Patches upon patches had been machine stitched over the frayed areas, as the
                       pillow case was passed from each mother to her daughter before finally being given as a gesture of friendship to me.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Some years later, I took the cloth from the drawer where it had been kept and carefully unpicked and ironed each patch 
                    and inserted them between the linen layers where the pillow would have been, exposing on both sides the tattered and 
                    torn edges of the fabric. As Masuma had taught me, I slowly stitched the layers together with running stitch (Figure 2), 
                    using the lines of tiny holes left from unstitching the patches to mark the edges where my needle turned. Basting the 
                    frayed layers together and feeling the silkiness of cool linen under my fingers, I thought of how my stitching echoed 
                    the work of women before me who had mended the cloth; but this time, stitching the layers together to deny the protective 
                    function of the pillow case shifted it into a different space.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I wanted to make the cloth beautiful as it had once been, but also to draw attention to the delicacy of the torn edges 
                    and create a shimmering surface of tiny marks (Figure 3), like the touch of misty rain on skin. bell hooks, recalling
                     her childhood in an ugly house, speaks of the aesthetic sense as emerging from an attitude of paying attention, of 
                     attending to, and being in the world, open to the qualities of things-in-themselves: “Aesthetics [ . . . ] is more 
                     than a philosophy or theory of art and beauty; it is a way of inhabiting space, a particular location, away of 
                     looking and becoming”

                </p>
                <p>
                    Stitching a cloth is a kind of becoming. Lost in the rhythm of stitching, my mind wanders, drifts in a reverie like 
                    a waking dream, while, at the same time, my fingers feel the tautness of the thread pulling and puckering the cloth.
                     I am aware of the sensation of easing out the wrinkles by smoothing my fingers along the rows of stitching, as the 
                     forces of gravity cause the cloth to bell and billow over my knees. I think of Elizabeth Grosz’s proposition that 
                     “art, through the plane of composition it throws over chaos, gives life to sensation that, disconnected from its 
                     origins or any destination or reception, maintains its connections with the infinite it expresses and from which it is drawn”.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Dreams are mysterious and uncontainable and strangely recall Grosz’s figure of the Mo ̈bius strip in their disorienting ravelling 
                    and unravelling of a subject’s inner and outer lives. I have wondered about those unknown men and women whose heads had lain against
                     the linen, wearing down the threads. Did the embroiderer surround their dreaming heads with trefoil leaves of clover as a sign of good fortune, 
                     to mitigate the danger of their souls drifting from the body in dreams?37 But how could I ever know who dreamed, asleep upon the pillow, and what they dreamed?

                    In 1908, a few years before the pillow case made its journey across the sea to Australia and more than a century before Masuma’s journey, William Butler Yeats wrote:
                </p>
                <p class="indented">
                    We have fallen in the dreams the ever-living Breathe on the burnished mirror of the world, And then smooth out with ivory hands and sigh
                </p>
                <p>
                    Perhaps this is the point—that another’s subjectivity is unknowable, yet we desire to connect, and this desire is expressed through stitching a poetics of cloth.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Fraying, the un-weaving of the edge of cloth, is counterpoint to selvedge, the tightly woven band that holds the edges of the cloth together and, with the warp, 
                    defines the borders of the cloth. Accepting the process of fraying along with the inevitability of change, and attending to their effects through stitching, might 
                    be a way of opening up the self to the forces that drive transformation and to embrace the uncertainty of becoming. In the intimacy of stitching, kantha creates a 
                    space of encounter, for exchanging stories not often told, stories that originated in territories as diverse as nineteenth-century Glasgow and Bengal, before being 
                    taken to Australia to become another story, stitched in the margins, yet central to our lives.
